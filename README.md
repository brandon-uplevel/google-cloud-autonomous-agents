## 📋 Usage

### **Getting Started**
1. Copy `.claude/` directory to your project
2. All agents are immediately available for use
3. Director of Engineering automatically coordinates team

### **Autonomous Operation**
```bash
# Example: Build a Gemini AI chat feature
# Director of Engineering automatically:
# 1. Analyzes requirements
# 2. Deploys appropriate specialists
# 3. Coordinates parallel development
# 4. Manages quality gates
# 5. Reports completion
```

### **Manual Agent Invocation**
```bash
# Use specific agent when needed
"Use the python-backend agent to implement Vertex AI integration"
"Use the security-specialist to review Google Cloud IAM configuration"
```

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### **Core Configuration**
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Complete autonomous workflow configuration
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Project-specific permissions and MCP integration
